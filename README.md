# aws
I will use this repository to add all the material that I've created to study my AWS certificates.

- ANKI DECKS -

These are flashcards to use with the application Anki (https://apps.ankiweb.net/). 
Anki, it's an open source application that you can download for your Laptop or Mobile.
The cards are configured with a question and an answer but feel free to add your changes.
I created decks for:
- AWS Certified Cloud Practicioner Study Guide - Which includes all the highlights content. Still workig on it!
- AWS Certified Cloud Practicioner Study Guide - Rewiew Questions - Which includes all the review questions after
each chapter, with the explanation about the answer. Here I will be adding more questions not just from the guide.

You just have to have the Anki Application installed and then you import the deck. 
TADA! That's all folks!
